I worked on Currency Progression, developed tools to extract data into spreadsheets and did data analysis with customizable parameters based on player playstyle.

I improved custom car driving feel, by creating custom driving profiles using scriptable objects.  
Created a custom editor to quickly save/load different profiles.

###  Tools I worked with:  
[SLATE](https://slate.paradoxnotion.com/): Created cutscenes and custom action clips  
[NodeCanvas](https://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/): Created FSMs, behaviour trees and custom nodes.
